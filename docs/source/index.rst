Feature-Rich PDF Annotator for C#/.NET Developers
===================================

**GroupDocs PDF Annotator** is a feature-rich tool for adding special notes and markups to PDFs. Its lightweight API architecture is artfully tailored to enable you to effortlessly incorporate it into your application.

With our Annotator your application will acquire the ability to add text annotations, highlights, callouts and other elements directly to the PDF without altering the original content. The annotations are saved to the document and can be viewed by using any PDF viewer. The annotated document can be then printed or forwarded in its completed form.

   All annotations and markups can still be edited when you re-open the document
